# Duck workshop

![Flashing duck](images/duck.jpg)

This repo is to archive the files required for the flashing duck workshop. The workshop's existence was at first an April fools day joke. It eventually became a real workshop.

In this repo you can find:
 + The eagle files for first and second version of circuit
 + The workshop presentation with notes
 + A BOM for the second version of the circuit (the final version)
